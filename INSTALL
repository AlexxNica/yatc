 1. Requirements
 2. Building on Linux/Unix
 3. Building on Windows
 4. Compiling and installing GLICT

1. Requirements
=============

- SDL 1.2		http://www.libsdl.org/
- GMP 4.2		http://gmplib.org/
- GLICT - latest SVN
- OpenGL and GLU
- autoconf 2.61
- automake 1.10



2. Building on Linux/Unix
=========================

1. Run "./autogen.sh".
2. Run "./configure"
3. Run "make"

3. Building on Windows
======================

There's a Code::Blocks project file included. You should install Code::Blocks
and use the aforementioned Code::Blocks project file to compile YATC.

This project file probably won't be usable with Code::Blocks v1.02RC1 (the 
latest "stable" build) -- so we recommend that you take the latest "unstable"
release of Code::Blocks.

4. Compiling and installing GLICT
=================================

We're using one library that you may have trouble finding and installing,
since it's written by one of our developers. This library is GLICT. 

(This is mainly from the YATC Development Google Group.)

1) Download GLICT SVN with:
   $ svn co https://glict.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/glict/trunk/glict glict
   (Generally, follow instructions from
       http://sourceforge.net/svn/?group_id=167920 )

2) Create a new project for GLICT. It should be of "static library" type.
   It should be called "GLICT".
3) Add all files in GLICT/ subfolder in it.
4) Build it!
5) You will end up with GLICT.lib or libGLICT.a depending on your
   compiler. (GLICT is developed with GCC, and in the past was regularly
   tested with MSVC2005.)
6) Copy the resulting file in your compiler's "lib/" folder. For example,
   in:
   * "/usr/lib/" for Debian GNU/Linux GCC
   * "C:\Dev-Cpp\lib" for Dev-Cpp
   * "C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio 8\VC\lib" for MSVC 2005
      (not express edition!)

   If you have other compiler you'll have to manage it yourself.
7) Copy the entire subfolder "GLICT/" which contains files such as
   "button.h", "window.h", "container.h" into your compiler's "include/"
   folder. For example:
   * "/usr/include/"
   * "C:\Dev-Cpp\include"
   * "C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio 8\VC\include"

This means you should have files such as this when you're over:
C:\Dev-Cpp\include\GLICT\button.h

(And don't forget: Dev-Cpp is just an IDE, GCC is the compiler that 
Dev-Cpp uses. But it's easier for me to put it among real compilers :P)
