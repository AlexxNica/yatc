 1. Requirements
 2. Building on Linux/Unix
 3. Building on Windows
 4. Devpaks and Debian packages

1. Requirements
===============

- SDL 1.2		http://www.libsdl.org/
- GMP 4.2		http://gmplib.org/
- GLICT 		https://glict.svn.sf.net/svnroot/glict/ (svn)
- SDL_gfx for SDL1.2
- OpenGL and GLU
- autoconf 2.61
- automake 1.10


2. Building on Linux/Unix
=========================

1. Run "./autogen.sh".
2. Run "./configure"
3. Run "make"

== 2.1. Compiling and installing GLICT ==

Adapt directories to your distribution. GLICT doesn't use automake yet.

1. svn co https://glict.svn.sf.net/svnroot/glict/trunk/glict/
2. cd glict/GLICT/
3. make
4. cp libGLICT.a /usr/lib/
5. cd ..
6. cp -R GLICT/ /usr/include/

3. Building on Windows with Dev-Cpp
===================================

You are expected to have DevCpp installed. Instructions are based around Windows XP environment, but you can easily adapt them to other OSes, if you turn on your brain. 

When instructed to fetch code from SVN repository, and you don't have a SVN client, you can use the WebDAV client built into the XP. Instructions are in chapter 3.3.

If you have any problems please try to fix them yourself, and then contact me via OTfans PM. If you really cannot find a solution, try contacting me anyway. If you report the problem we can fix these instructions together -- if not, someone else will have the same problem!

== 3.1. Compiling GLICT ==

1. Fetch the GLICT code from the SVN.
   (https://glict.svn.sf.net/svnroot/glict/trunk/glict/)
2. Start Devcpp and create a new project of type "Empty project". 
   Call it "libGLICT".
   Choose type "Static library".
   Save it in the root GLICT folder (next to "history.txt"). 
   Call the file: "libGLICT.dev"
3. Click Project->Add to project. 
   Select all files in the "GLICT/" subfolder 
    ("button.cpp", "button.h", "container.cpp", "container.h", ...)
4. Copy the entire "GLICT/" subfolder to C:\Dev-Cpp\include 
     (you should now have files such as:
      C:\Dev-Cpp\include\GLICT\button.h
      C:\Dev-Cpp\include\GLICT\container.h, ...)
5. Click Execute->Compile
6. Go to the root GLICT folder. 
7. Find "libGLICT.a". 
8. Copy it to "C:\Dev-Cpp\lib\libGLICT.a"

== 3.2. Compiling YATC ==

1) First, you'll need GMP and SDL. Get and install the Devpaks.
2) Fetch YATC SVN.
3) Open the yatc.dev project file.
4) Go to Execute->Compile.
5) Copy C:\Dev-Cpp\bin\SDL.dll to YATC's folder. 

You should have YATC.exe built in the directory where YATC.dev was, and it should run correctly. Don't forget to copy Tibia.pic, Tibia.dat and Tibia.spr to YATC's folder!

== 3.3. Fetching SVN using XP's WebDAV client ==

Here are instructions on how to do fetch a Subversion repository without a Subversion client under XP, using the WebDAV client.

1. Go to My Network Places. 
2. Click on Add a network place. 
3. Select "Choose another network location". 
4. Under "Internet or network address", enter SVN repository's URL. You'll get a warning about security certificate being invalid; just ignore it. 
5. If you want, change the name of the shortcut that'll be created in My Network Places. 
6. Then make sure that "Open this network place when I click finish" is checked.
7. Click Finish.
   The repository's contents will open as a more-or-less regular folder. 
8. Copy the files you need out of it into a new folder. 

Then, proceed with instructions!

4. Devpaks and Debian packages
==============================

Here we include links to required Devpaks and Debian packages.
GLICT is not officially available as Devpak nor as Debian package, but
compile instructions are included above.

== 4.1. Devpaks

SDL: 		http://devpaks.org/details.php?devpak=200
SDL_gfx:	http://old.devpaks.org/show.php?devpak=160
GMP:		http://pekayz.googlepages.com/GMP.DevPak
GLICT:		(compile instructions provided, no devpak available)

== 4.2. Debian/Ubuntu packages

Just copypaste this to root commandline (type su and type root password, then 
punch these lines in):

apt-get install libsdl1.2-dev libsdl-gfx1.2-dev libgmp3-dev autoconf automake \
		libgl1-mesa-dev libglu1-mesa-dev
