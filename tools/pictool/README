ANSI C converter for Tibia's PIC files

1) Why a new converter?

Many people are familiar with existence of Trooper's editor for PIC files. 
However this editor is somewhat crudely written; for the simple task it should
perform, it uses way too many libraries and features of C++. What I mean is,
Boost is unnecessary; ANSI C is surely supported on even more platforms than,
for example, Boost.

Then, it is interesting that Trooper disregarded portability to 16-bit and 
64-bit platforms (the latter being more and more prominent on the market).
For example, he declared the Tibia.pic's signature as "unsigned version;"
which could mean anything between a 16 bit integer and a 64 bit integer,
some day perhaps even more.

Another thing is a problem, and that is the licensing issue. Trooper has not
made a statement that his editor is free software (either GPL or another 
license). So, I decided to write a converter which will clearly be under the
GPLv2 license.

Of course, credits go to Trooper for writing the original converter using
which I could figure out the format quickly and painlessly. Thanks, Trooper!
