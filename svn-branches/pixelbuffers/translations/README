Hi,

for instructions on how to translate with gettext refer here:
 http://oriya.sarovar.org/docs/gettext/

In short:
* we (the devs) will update yatc.pot file
* you need to copy yatc.pot to translations/<YOURLANGUAGE>.po
* you send us your .po file

If you already translated stuff, and we updated the .pot file:
 msgmerge -s -U <YOURLANGUAGE>.po yatc.pot
or use
 cd translations
 ./merge.sh <YOURLANGUAGE>

DO NOT SEND US .po FILE THAT DERIVES FROM .pot NOT GENERATED BY US.
Even if you run translations/prepare.sh yourself.

<YOURLANGUAGE> should be full name of language ('croatian', 'swedish', ...)
and not the ISO code. Use ISO code where appropriate (e.g. when updating
build.sh)

Best way to give us what we need is:
* update build.sh
* run "svn add <YOURLANGUAGE>.po"
* run "svn diff"
* send us output of svn diff

No research was done for using gettext under Windows. You're on your own
there; please send us instructions if you figure it out and can describe it
in a sensible manner.

We're still new in all this, who knows if we'll ever make translating our
priority, but we're here to learn.

Most importantly - remember to send us your .po file.
