Do you intend to package YATC, like "zoulnix" already did for Arch Linux? (Packages <a href="http://aur.archlinux.org/packages.php?ID=21371" target="_blank">yatc</a> and <a href="http://aur.archlinux.org/packages.php?ID=21303" target="_blank">yatc-svn</a>)

<div>Please, remember that before you make a package, it's <span style="font-weight:bold">polite</span> to contact upstream authors. We want to keep you up to date in case of important breakages, and in case of releasing new versions of software. Don't you want your package to stay up to date?&nbsp;</div>
