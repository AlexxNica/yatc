<div>We'd like to remind all users that while
we do have the feature to switch to CipSoft's Tibia RSA key, we
discourage use on their servers.</div>
<div>
<br>
<b>First,</b> we'd like to remind all users about the <a href="http://www.tibia.com/support/?subtopic=tibiarules&amp;rule=3c" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Tibia Rules section 3c</a>. Previously, it could be found as section 3d. <br>
<br>
<b>Second,</b> interesting reading regarding this section is three-year old discussion (when we were all still "children") about <a href="http://otfans.net/showthread.php?t=26229" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Cipsoft's policy regarding third party clients</a>. Not much, and very childish, but it contains a statement from a CipSoft official.<br>
<br>
<b>Third,</b> in last few releases there have been several technical
measures implemented lately into the protocol, which raise doubts about
safety of use of ANY third party software. Stuff such as checksums or
the newly implemented garbage bytes may have <i>hidden footprints</i> which allow CipSoft to detect if they were generated using their client or third party software. <b>During 2009, <a href="http://otfans.net/showthread.php?t=147406" target="_blank">automatic bans</a> <a href="http://otfans.net/showthread.php?t=149249" target="_blank">have occured</a> for use of YATC.</b><br>
<br>
We will continue to officially discourage players from using CipSoft's
servers, and disclaim all responsibility when you are doing so. While
YATC is not and will never be a cheat tool, nor does it modify the
original software, it could theoretically be identified as such.<br>
<br>
We can be reasonably sure that you will not be identified or banned
when using YATC while playing on an OpenTibia Server. This of course
depends on modifications the administrators make to OTS in order to
identify third party software. Currently we're matching the behavior
OTS expect. We cannot be sure we match CipSoft's expected behavior. <br>
<br>
Thank you for your time!<br>
