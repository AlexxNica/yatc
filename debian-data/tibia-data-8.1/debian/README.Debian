This is a packaging of Cipsoft's Tibia data files repackaged for use in
Debian-based systems by Ivan Vucica.  Licensing has not been discussed with 
Cipsoft and until then the packager takes no responsibility for how you use
them, and he will not try to submit this packaging to any distribution. 

These files have not been modified in any way except they were repackaged.
