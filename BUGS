This is a list of known bugs. It's a reference for us to know what to fix, and for you to know what to NOT report repeatedly. This is not an exhaustive list of bugs, there's many more FIXMEs in the source code.

Again: do NOT repeat the bugs stated here. Only tell about them if they're stated as FIXED but you still experience them.

Bugs begin:

* this list is not categorized ;)

* server can send magic effects, animated text, text messages etc on a tile that does not exist yet -- we should ignore them, not report them as bugs (error message "Magic effect - !tile")
* pressing enter or cursor keys in character list doesn't work
* login status box does not appear during second logon
	- FIXED
* dragging window does not display its contents while it is being dragged
* dragging the box in scrollbar does not work
* scrollbar is not skinned
* names of creatures are not centered
* names of creatures seem to be printed with wrong font width
* there are differences in width of text typed out in textbox and one that appears in console
* automake doesnt install into $prefix/games, but into $prefix/bin which is wrong 
	- NOTBUG Possibly. People from debian-devel-games say it should
	  be this way, and ./configure --bindir=\\\$(prefix)/games specifies
	  the directory.
* sdl engine knows no clipping
* ghosting is not implemented
