YATC Roadmap
============
Here's a small proposed roadmap for YATC. Changes are ok before work starts
on a certain release, changing after not recommended. (0.1 being exception.)

Work on areas not outlined for a release should be discouraged. Order in the
list also kind of denotes priority.

For the latest roadmap, see:

should comment.
