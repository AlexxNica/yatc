This is the port of YATC to MSVC 2008 compiler toolchain, 
graciously provided by fike. His patch was sent on Jan4
and was for revision 3811, but I have applied this on 
Mar30 2009 to revision 4075. I have not personally tested 
if the code compiles on MSVC. 

Libraries required for compiling can be found in the other
section of our repository:
 http://opentibia.svn.sf.net/svnroot/opentibia/yatc/lib/yatc.vc9

I will not be maintaining this port; any patches will
however be accepted.

Thanks, fike!
