Hi,

I'll just give credit to Third Cog Software for producing the fine frameworks for SDL libraries
we use. Also, thanks to whoever produced GMP framework for use with Glasgow Haskell Compiler.

Additional thanks to Third Cog Software (Joachim Bengtsson, you rock!) for help from their 
site with regards how to properly produce frameworks, namely GLICT framework, and for help on 
how to properly embed frameworks.

Also I found a blog entry that told me that I need to select header files to be PUBLIC in
order for them to be included in framework. Thanks to PantherModem!

I'll probably add the frameworks to .../svnroot/yatc/lib/mac later on. I just wanted to
give credit where credit is due.
