================================

YATC is a client for any game that uses Tibia-compatible protocol. It is being
developed as a part of the OpenTibia project. We have chosen the name YATC
since name OpenTibia Client was already taken by a project by another author.  

It is currently in planning phase, and we are doing some basic coding. We plan
support for SDL, OpenGL and DirectX based drawing engines. GLICT is planned to
be used as the user interface. 

Currently there are no more plans to announce. Stay tuned!
