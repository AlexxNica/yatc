ABOUT REPLAY.BINARY

This file was produced by a special utility given by Thomac. Here's what we
have to say about it (in net/connectionreplay.h):


// This class performs local file replay services.
// Replay files are of this format:
//
// repeat {
//  <uint32_t> time
//  <uint16_t> message length
//  {
//   message itself
//  }
// }
//
// No encryption or checksum applies.
// Only gameworld is replayable.
