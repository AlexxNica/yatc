================================

YATC is a client for any game that uses Tibia-compatible protocol. It is being
developed as a part of the OpenTibia project. We have chosen the name YATC
since name OpenTibia Client was already taken by a project by another author.

The code has taken shape, but it is still in early development. We develop
support for SDL and OpenGL based drawing engines. GLICT is the current
user interface library. For now we can connect to the login server, display
character list, connect to game world, display basic map, and we can move
around.

This is readme for version 0.2.2SVN.

===============================
1. Quick logon

If you need compile instructions, please read INSTALL. If you have already
compiled, or you have downloaded a binary, please read on.

Copy Tibia.spr, Tibia.dat and Tibia.pic from another client into YATC. We
currently cannot provide these files due to copyright issues, and we have not
created our own files. Then, start YATC. Go to Options->Network, and enter
the server address. Then go to Enter Game and log on using your account
number and password.

We currently support protocols 8.0 to 8.31. Autodetection will see from which
version of the client you have copied the files and will use the appropriate
protocol. You can manually switch protocol in Options->Network.

Under GNU/Linux, do not forget that caps matter. Tibia.spr is not the same
as tibia.spr.

==============================

more characters than fits in the list, use the arrows to find the character

==============================
5. User Interface - Game

On the top right you'll find the inventory. Right of it is the map. On the top
right you will find the traffic meter. It measures the amount of bytes
transmitted (TX), received (RX) and total (++). It also measures the same
numbers per hour (in bytes per hour, kibibytes per hour, and mibibytes per
hour).

On the bottom you will find a text box which you can use to chat. Pressing
any letter or number focuses on the textbox automatically.

Use arrow keys to move.

==============================
6. Configuration file

After you first launch YATC and close it, a file named 'yatc.cfg' will be
generated in the working directory. There are some options that are
inaccessible from the user interface so here's documentation. The options
are as follows:

  This can be either 0 or 1. 0 sets the SDL rendering engine (default), 1 sets
  the OpenGL rendering engine.

7. Observed issues

* Some tiles are not rendered at all.
* If creature steps over another creature, the creatures are swapped.
  (Ordering problem.)
* Under GNU/Linux, SDL timer mechanism seems to be causing freezes.
